# Others information
I won't take responsibility for any issues that may arise when using **unofficial Facebook tools**. They may modify certain things that could cause the script to behave unexpectedly and not as intended.

I understand that the script doesn't send any sensitive information and only simulates user actions. Therefore, there should be no privacy risks involved.
